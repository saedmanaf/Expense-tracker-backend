💰 Expense Tracker – RESTful API with Java & H2 Database
A simple, no-nonsense expense tracking API—built to solidify my RESTful CRUD + database skills and push my Spring Boot knowledge to the next level.

🎯 Why This Project?
I’m four months into my Java course, and this project is my trial-by-fire to:

 Master Spring Boot and RESTful API development
 Implement full CRUD functionality for expenses
 Work with relational databases (H2 for now, PostgreSQL later)
 Break things, fix them, and (hopefully) learn before breaking them again

📢 Once all endpoints are fixed, this repo will go public!

Also, let’s be real—I’m milking my free IntelliJ Ultimate while I can, because once that student license expires… it’s hello, open-source editors!

🏆 End goal? A solid portfolio → internship → job (or world domination, we’ll see).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Java + Spring Boot
Database: H2 (for now, PostgreSQL later)
API Documentation: Swagger UI
Testing: JUnit + Mockito
IDE: IntelliJ Ultimate (before I’m forced back to VS Code)


📌 Features:

✅ Already Working
 CRUD Operations – Add, edit, delete, and retrieve expenses
 Swagger UI – Auto-generated API documentation & testing
 H2 Console – Debugging directly in the browser
 Error Handling & Validations – Because crashing isn’t fun

🚧 Still Cooking
 Authentication – JWT? Firebase? Magic? To be decided
 PostgreSQL/MySQL Support – When I finally commit to a database
 Better Exception Handling – Because I always forget something


⚡ API Endpoints Overview
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/expenses	Fetch all expenses
GET	/api/expenses/{id}	Get an expense by ID
POST	/api/expenses	Add a new expense
PUT	/api/expenses/{id}	Update an existing expense
DELETE	/api/expenses/{id}	Remove an expense


⚡ Progress So Far
 Backend CRUD working like a charm
 H2 Database up and running
 Swagger UI making life easier
❌ Authentication (coming soon™)
❌ Frontend (uhhh... maybe? Maybe not?)


💡 Lessons Learned So Far
 Spring Boot is magic… until you debug for hours.
 H2 is great for testing but would implode in production.
 Writing clean endpoints is easy—handling edge cases is a nightmare.
 Swagger saves time (and possibly my sanity).



🚀 Next Steps
 Fix any broken endpoints & validate inputs properly
 Implement authentication (JWT? Firebase? Witchcraft?)
 Refactor code for better structure
 Deploy (without breaking the entire thing)



🌟 Contributions & Feedback
This project will be public soon, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!

⭐ Star this repo if you think it’s cool—or just to support my IntelliJ dependency.



😂 Final Thoughts
If you’re still here, you’re either:

 Actually interested in my project (which means you have excellent taste, obviously)
 A recruiter scanning for red flags (I assure you, my exception handling is better than my life choices)
 Lost, confused, but too deep in now to back out (we ride at dawn)

Either way—glad to have you! 🚀 Stick around, watch me build cool stuff, and if this breaks in production… well, let’s just call that an immersive learning experience 😎.

And if nothing else, at least you can say you witnessed whatever this is unfold in real time. Exciting, right? Right??
